# Configuration file for OT console.
#
# This is a yaml file. Much more concise than xml.
# Please check http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#id857168 for yaml spec.
# Please check https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml for using yaml in java.
# CAUTION: indentation is significant for yaml parsing.
# if information is misaligned (especially in the menu hierarchy), parsing will fail.
# Never use tab. 3 spaces is recommended.
